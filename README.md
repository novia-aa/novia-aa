## 👋 About Me

I am a **Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities**, working across **machine learning research, LLM fine-tuning, and deployable AI systems**.

My work focuses on **trustworthy and data-efficient learning**, including **multi-objective Bayesian optimization**, **calibration-aware LLM fine-tuning**, **graph-based urban representation learning**, and **Document AI**. I enjoy bridging **theory → experimentation → system deployment**, ensuring research ideas translate into usable systems.
